This project is a Multilingual Fraud Detection System designed to classify both SMS messages and phone call recordings as either Fraudulent or Normal in three languages: English, Hindi, and Telugu. It leverages a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP), traditional machine learning, and deep learning techniques to process and analyze both text and audio inputs. For SMS classification, the system uses an LSTM architecture for English to effectively manage variable-length inputs and capture contextual dependencies, while Hindi and Telugu messages are processed using TF-IDF vectorization with Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression. For call classification, the system utilizes the Google Speech-to-Text API to transcribe audio recordings into text, which are then classified using the same models as in SMS classification. This ensures consistent and accurate detection across both communication modes. The web interface is built using Streamlit, providing an intuitive user experience, while core functionalities rely on libraries like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and pickle for model handling and predictions. This multilingual, multimodal approach ensures effective fraud detection for users across diverse linguistic backgrounds.
